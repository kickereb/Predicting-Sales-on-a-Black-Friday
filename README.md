## 1. Introduction
The Friday following Thanksgiving Day is called a Black Friday in the United States. It has been reportedly the busiest shopping day in the United States since 2005. Black Friday is particularly important for retailers since sales on this day affects investor confidence. Investors make predictions for sales on a Black Friday and if the retailers indicate good sales, investors get an indication of a profitable shopping season. Hence, there is an increase in the stock price of such retail companies. Thus, analysis of historical customer data on Black Fridays to realize important customer segments, their preferred products and targeting advertisements to the right customers is essential for retailers to increase sales and gain the confidence of their investors. By forecasting sales on a Black Friday from historic data, retailers can accordingly stock requisite quantities of products in their inventory to minimize missed sales as much as possible.
